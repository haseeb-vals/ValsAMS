This is used to handle business logic, validations, and caluclations etc

- The interface defines which business functions are available for use
- The "Services" folder applies/implements these business functions

In context of our software:
- This allows us to keep the logic out of the Controllers. Controllers should only be responsible for orchestration.
- Make rules/functions available across multiple endpoints
- Keeps code organized, testable, and modular
