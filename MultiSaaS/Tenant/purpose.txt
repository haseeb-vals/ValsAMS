Holds all tenant specific logic and context providers. This is where we define how to identify, store,
and retrieve tenant context during request lifecycle.

In context of our software:
- Resolves tenant identity
- Store current tenant in context
- Apply tenant-specific logic throughout the app.

For example,
- TenantContext.cs = Holds info like TenantId
- ITenantProvider.cs = Defines and implements tenant resolution strategy
